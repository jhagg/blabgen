LOCALIZATION
===========

Gettext.js is used to provide gettext support in JavaScript.

Message catalogs are located in
public/locales/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.json.

Note that it is the .json files that are used by Gettext.js, and not the .po
files. po2json is used to translate PO catalog file in messages.po to JSON
format that is used by Gettext.js:

	> po2json messages.po > messages.json

Default language is English. All original message strings are defined in the
HTML source of the UI (index.html). Translatable message strings are tagged
using the class 'translatable' on the containing element. HTML markup is
allowed in the message strings.

When the user selects a new locale, the corresponding JSON message catalog
is loaded via an AJAX call, and all text strings in the UI are translated
using the loaded catalog.


JavaScript implementation
-------------------------

The core visys object holds an instance of the current Gettext object in
variable 'gt'. Loading a new locale is done by calling:

	set_locale( locale, opts )

Which will load the new translation map and update the UI and where 'locale'
is the new locale, and 'opts' is a hash of options. If opts.initial is false,
the UI will be blocked until the new translation map is loaded and the UI
updated.

The loading of the translation map and the updating of the UI is handled by
two functions:

	load_translation_map( locale, opts )
	update_ui_messages()

Where 'locale' is the locale to load, 'opts' is a hash of options, where
opts.success is called on success, and opts.error on error.
